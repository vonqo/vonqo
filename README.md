### Hi there 👋

I like to discover design solutions around the high-loaded systems, operating system and graphic processing. But I usually ended up writing some extreme dank spaghetti code and most of my time spend on playing DotA 2, World of WarCraft and watching LOTR over and over again. 


- :trollface: 3-4 years of coding experience in Ulaanbaatar, MN 🇲🇳 and California, US 🇺🇸
- 🐋 Looking to collaborate on [PunkOwl/Gestalt](https://github.com/PunkOwl/gestalt) and [PunkOwl/Devola](https://github.com/PunkOwl/devola)
- 🧙 Specialized in Java, Dart and C++. I like to follow principles of OOP, ORM, Multilayered architecture.
