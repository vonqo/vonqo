### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I like to discover design solutions around the high-loaded systems, operating system and graphic processing. But I ended up writing some extreme dank spaghetti code and  most of my time spend on playing DotA 2 and World Of WarCraft. 

I have 3-4 years of coding experience in Ulaanbaatar, MN and California, US.

- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on [PunkOwl/Gestalt](https://github.com/PunkOwl/gestalt) and [PunkOwl/Devola](https://github.com/PunkOwl/devola)
- âš¡ I'm specialized in Java, Dart and C++. Some dynamic languages such as Javascript and Python bugs me sometime haha.
