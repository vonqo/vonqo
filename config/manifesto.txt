MANIFESTO

I believe as an engineering enthusiast, designing your own solution against the problem is the most rewarding progress regardless of your skillset. It is an indeed delightful vibe. Studying about previous solutions and upcoming changes will enrich our arsenal. Openly sharing our know-how, experience and insight is the part of an improvement. 
Modern software programming has became ultimate digital playground. Advance in that playground!
